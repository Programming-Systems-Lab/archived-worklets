<h3>Description</h3>
The Worklets system provides micro-workflow through mobile agents that
adapt computation to component context.  It is designed as a mobile
code infrastructure intended for dynamic re-configuration of
third-party systems.  Instead of bringing down entire components of a
distributed system at runtime for recompilation, Worklets carrying
Java mobile code can be injected transparently into system components
for incremental adaptation.  Host components must include, or be
wrapped with, a generic Worklet Virtual Machine (WVM) and
host-specific adapters exposing indigenous reconfiguration
capabilities.  The Worklets System depends on Java 1.4.

<p>
The system is principally composed of WVM's, Worklets and
WorkletJunctions.  The WVM provides the execution environment as well
as harboring the interface to the system.  A Worklet is composed of
WorkletJunctions which contain the execution code and addressing
information for the Worklet.  The Worklet thus acts as an agent
bringing the WorkletJunction to the WVM to perform actions which are
specified in the WorkletJunction.
</p>

<p>
The typical use of Worklets is to insert WorkletJunctions into a
Worklet and send it into a system running a WVM to monitor the system
by probing or to effect it by modifying system components.  A
JunctionPlanner can also be added to WorkletJunctions to specify
meta-data such as the number of iterations to execute.  Examples of
these Worklets are included in the distribution and a walk through of
a simple system is provided at the <a target=#walkthrough>end</a> of
the documentation.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

For Worklets to act on a target system the WVM must be "installed"
into the system.  The WVM provides the execution environment in which
the Worklets operate.  To install the WVM you need to create a WVM and
pass it a reference to the system to be instrumented: <br>

<p>
<font size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
WVM _wvm = new WVM(this);
</font>
</p>

<p>
This constructor defaults many values which can be specified through
other constructors (please see the <a href=./index.html>Worklets'
Javadocs</a>).  In the code above, <font size=2 face='Terminal,
Arial'>this</font> is a reference to the system.  The Worklets system
uses this reference to invoke methods provided through a host adaptor
interface (please see the <a href=#examples>examples<a> section
below).
</p>

<p>
After the WVM has been installed, Worklets can be sent in to do a
variety of tasks such as invoking interface methods or executing other
bits of code.  Since the Workets are transported between WVMs, a
Worklet must be bootstrapped into the Worklets system by an
originating WVM.  This can be done by creating a WVM on the
originating system and installing and deploying the Worklet from that
WVM.
</p>

<font size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
WVM wvm = new WVM(new Object(), InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostAddress(), "newWVM");<br>
Worklet wkl = new Worklet(null);	// create a Worklet<br>
wkl.deployWorklet(wvm);			// send it away!<br>
</font>

<p>
Worklets themselves are composed of WorkletJunctions which contain the
execution points.  Each WorkletJunction has an execute method that is
invoked when the Worklet reaches the destination specified in the
WorkletJunction.  Thus one Worklet can act on several systems,
provided the WVM is installed.  Also, the Worklet can be communicated
(between WVMs) through different methods, namely sockets or Java RMI.
Additionally, there are ways to secure Worklet transportation, as
described in the <a href="security.html">security</a> section.
</p>

<p>
Here is a basic Worklet construction with one WorkletJunction that is
bootstraped with a WVM: <br>

<font size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
<br>
import psl.worklets.*;<br>
<br>
public class DispatchWorklet implements Serializable {<br>
  // create an originating WVM<br>
  WVM wvm = new WVM(new Object(), "localhost", "DispatchWorklet");<br>
<br>
  WorkletJunction originJunction = null; <br>
  WorkletJunction wj = new WorkletJunction("localhost", "target") {<br>
    public void init(Object _system, WVM _wvm) {<br>
    }<br>
<br>
    public void execute() {<br>
      System.out.println("Hello System");<br>
    }<br>
  };<br>
<br>
  Worklet wkl = new Worklet(originJunction);<br>
  wkl.addJunction(wj);<br>
  wkl.deployWorklet(wvm);<br>
  System.exit(0);<br>
}
</font>
<p>

<p>
The code above creates a WorkletJunction to be sent to a local system
under the name of "target".  Once it gets there, the WorkletJunction
will simply print out "Hello System".  The <font size=2
face='Terminal, Arial'> originJunction</font> used above specifies
where the Worklet is to return to when finished with all of its
WorkletJunctions.  If <font size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>null</font>
is specified, as above, then it doesn't have to return.  <br>
<br>
As the range of Worklet applications vary widely, we provide an <a
href=#examples>example<a> of Worklets being used to probe a system and
then again to effect it. Also, please see the <a href=./index.html>
Worklets' Javadocs</a> for API information.
</p>

<p>
<h3><a name="examples">Examples</a></h3>
In this example a simple system is created, instrumented, probed, and effected.
</p>

<h4>Example system: Greeter</h4>

The example shown here is a simple system where two entities 
communicate continuously through a given protocol.
<a href=examples/Greeter.java>Greeter.java</a> provides the interface for
all Greeters and <a href=examples/politeGreeter.java>politeGreeter.java</a>  
implements the Greeter.  The polite Greeters simply exchange greetings back and 
forth while being prompted by a preset greeting.  To start the Greeter system, 
compile the politeGreeter.java and run, on one terminal: <br>

<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
java politeGreeter localhost 9200 wvm1 localhost 9221 true<br>
</font>
<br>

and on another terminal run: <br>
<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
java politeGreeter localhost 9201 wvm2 localhost 9220 true<br>
</font>

<p>
The first and second arguments are the local hostname and socket
number to try binding to.  The third argument is the WVM name.  The
fourth and fifth arguments are the remote host and port number to
communicate with.  The last (sixth) argument is whether to initially
allow communciation and whether to try to initiate a conversation.
When the first invocation above is executed, the other Greeter is not
created yet, so nothing happens.  When the second Greeter is created
it starts the conversation with the first Greeter.
</p>

<p>
We "instrument" the system, or install the WVM, on the line: <br>
<font size=2 face='Terminal,Arial'> WVM wvm = new WVM(this);<br> </font>
by creating a WVM from within the politeGreeter and passing it a
reference to the parent system.  By doing this, Worklets can interact
with the system through the API (Greeter.java).
</p>


<h4>Probing the Greeter</h4>

<p>
Now we want to probe the system to see what's going on inside.  For
DASADA related probing, it is important to conform to the 
<a href=psl/probelets/Probeable.html>Probelet API</a>.  In the following
example I do not implement this API, but in the <a href=#FAQ>FAQ</a> section
I discuss the API as related to Worklets.
<p>

<p>
The probe <a href=examples/probeGreeter.java>probeGreeter.java</a> is
sent into the politeGreeter system to find out the greeting being used
and whether they are currently talking.  Look at the Probelet class to
see the interaction with the host system.  <br> (ie. the line: <font
size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'> String greeting =
((Greeter)_system).getGreeting(); </font>)
</p>

<p>
To execute probeGreeter, run: <br>
<br>
<font size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'> 
java probeGreeter localhost wvm1 9200</font>)
</p>

<h4>Effecting the Greeter</h4>

<p>
Now let's suppose the politeGreeter system wasn't working so great and that
they weren't talking.
</p>
run, on one terminal: <br>

<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
java politeGreeter localhost 9200 wvm1 localhost 9221 false<br>
</font>
<br>

and on another terminal run: <br>
<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
java politeGreeter localhost 9201 wvm2 localhost 9220 false<br>
</font>

<p>
Now we'll send in an effector to remedy the system so that the
Greeters are again talking to each other.  We do this in <a
href=examples/effectGreeter.java>effectGreeter.java</a>.  In
effectGreeter, we invoked the neccessary methods for the Greeters to
talk to each other.  
</p>

<p>
To execute effectGreeter, run: <br>
<br>
<font size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'> 
java effectGreeter</font>
</p>

<p>
In effectGreeter we hardcode in the destinations of the
WorkletJunctions simply for convenience.  Notice that the probeGreeter
and effectGreeter files are very much the same.  The only difference
is in the methods invoked and, of course, the names of the classes
(ie. Probelet vs. Effectlet).
</p>

<h4>Example Summary</h4>

<p>
In this example we showed a system being installed with the WVM.  We
then showed the system being probed and effected.  Though this was a
very simple example, it can be used to do further testing and learning
of how Worklets can be used.  For example we can actually change the
"protocol", or language, that the Greeters are using.  Also, we
restricted ourselves to only invoking API methods but any execution
code can be specified in the execute method (as allowed through
security policy.)  Applications can be sent in for execution as well.
These examples are included in the <a href="">Worklets
distribution</a>.
