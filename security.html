<h3>Description</h3>
The Worklet security system provides methods for securing Worklet
transmission.  The vulnerable objects are the RMI (Remote Method
Invocation) transport layer, the WVM (Worklet Virtual Machine)
transport layer and the class loaders.  Other objects that have or
provide methods for security measures are HostnameVerifier and
WorkletJunctions.
</p>

<p>
The RMI Transport layer involves an RMI registry, associated RMI
servers and class loaders.  Only one registry can be created on a
specific host:port to which many RMI servers can be bound.  A secure
registry authenticates all registry calls such as server lookups,
binds, and unbinds.  A secure RMI server uses custom secure sockets to
authenticate and encrypt all communication.  In the instance of a
secure server, the default RMI class loader is set to our own
implementation that uses a class loader with secure sockets.  Both
plain and secure RMI servers can be bound to plain registries but only
secure RMI servers can be bound to secure registries.  Communication
between RMI servers can only proceed plain-plain or secure-secure.
Depending on the security level (described in the Usage section) the
RMI server could have either only plain, only secure, or both class
loaders available to load classes.
</p>

<p>
The WVM transport layer includes server sockets and class loaders.
Depending on the level of security the transport layer can be created
with plain, secure, or both types of server sockets and associated
class loaders.  
</p>

<p>
A HostnameVerifier is also implemented and is used on the remote
(receiving) end.  This object is used by the remote host if the
hostname of the sending WVM is not recognized from the CA certificate
file.  The specification of the hosts that are allowed and denied is
described in the usage section.
<p>

</p>
There are situations where the user of the WorkletJunctions could be
uncertain of the security specifications at a certain WVM.  The user
can now specify parameters that allow the users to specify which
methods of transport (plain RMI, secure RMI, plain socket, secure
socket) the WorkletJunction should try and in what order.  The RMI
related methods specify what type of communication to try when looking
up the recipient RMI server, not the actual RMI server.  The socket
related features specify the type of socket to try connecting on.  The
ability to specify transport methods contributes to the robustness of
WorkletJunction communication.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
Note that all previous functionality is retained.  This section
documents the features pertinent to Worklet Security.  I make a
delineation between the <a href="#remote_host">remote</a> and <a
href="#local_host">local</a> hosts.  The remote host represents the
intended recipient of the Worklet while the local host is the entity
that is sending the Worklet.
</p>

<p>
<h4><a name="remote_host">Remote Host</a></h4>
To create a plain host you need not specify any parameters, like
this:
</p>

<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
java psl.worklets.WVM<br>
</font>

<p>
The name and port of the RMI server will default to WVM_Host and
9100.  If a remote host is created in this manner communication will
not be authenticated nor encrypted.  You can specify the RMI server
name and port by using the switches -name and -port.  See java
psl.worklets.WVM -help for option details.
</p>

<p>
To create secure hosts you must specify at least the keys file,
password, and WVM properties file (WVM file).  Because the WVM file
must contain the keysfile and password it is usually sufficient to
simply specify the WVM file.  The keys file is the file containing the
public/private keys of the host and the password is the passphrase
specified in the creation of the keysfile.  For more information on
how to create a keysfile see the <a href=#FAQ>FAQ</a> below.  The WVM file holds the
security specifications.  These security specifications can be
specified by setting environment variables with the -D java switch or
non the command line.  The parameter loading precedence is:<br>
<ul>
<li>Environment variables</li>
<li>WVM file</li>
<li>command line specification</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The WVM file contains property=value pairs separated by white space.
The important parameters in the WVM file are the keysfile and
password as these are used by the Worklet system at different times.
It is <u>very</u> important that the security of this file is set at
the operating systems level, meaning that the permissions on this file
should be set accordingly.  For example, for maximum security I would
set the permission to user read-only.  This can be done under Unix
with the following:
</p>

<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
chmod a-rwx wvm_properties<br>
chmod u+r wvm_properties<br>
</font>

<p>
Included with the distribution should be an example WVM file named
``wvm_properties''.  It should look like this: 
</p>

<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
# WVM host related parameters<br>
WVM_RMI_PORT=9100	# port that the rmi registry will be created on<br>
WVM_RMI_NAME=target	# name that the RMI server will be bound to<br>
<br>
# Security related parameters <br>
WVM_KEYSFILE=testkeys	# file holding the public/private keys<br>
WVM_PASSWORD=passphrase	# password into the keysfile. <br>
WVM_SSLCONTEXT=TLS	# SSL context instance to use<br>
WVM_KEYMANAGER=SunX509	# key manager implementation type<br>
WVM_KEYSTORE=JKS	# key store implementation type<br>
WVM_RNG=SHA1PRNG	# random number generator algorithm to use<br>
javax.net.ssl.trustStore=samplecacerts # location of the certified security certificates.<br>
WVM_HOSTS_ALLOW=localhost,127.0.0.1 # allowed hosts<br>
WVM_HOSTS_DENY=			    # denied hosts<br>
WVM_FILE=wvm_properties	# reference to this file<br>
<br>
# security level of the WVM.  <br>
# 0: no security. <br>
# 1: low security = plain RMI Registry, secure RMI server, <br>
#     plain and secure server sockets, and <br>
#     plain and secure class loaders.<br>
# 2: medium security = same as 1 but with a secure RMI Registry<br>
# 3: high security = secure RMI Registry, secure RMI server, <br>
#    secure server socket and secure class loaders.<br>
WVM_SECURITY_LEVEL=1	<br>
</font>

<p>
Notice the last parameter of WVM_SECURITY_LEVEL.  This parameter is
what you would modify to tailor the security level according to the
needs at a certain WVM.  A security level of 1 is the most flexible as
it creates a registry that will allow binding by both plain and secure
RMI servers.  Also created with a security level of 1 are plain and
secure server sockets and class loaders.  The only difference between
security level 1 and 2 is that the registry is secure in the latter.
A security level of 3 creates a WVM host that has a secure RMI server
that must be bound to a secure registry, a secure server socket, and only
secure class loaders.  There is a plain server socket created, but
that is used only for internal purposes for robust registry upkeep.
</p>

<p>
The WVM_HOSTS_ALLOW and WVM_HOSTS_DENY specify which hosts on the
remote end are allowed and denied.  If no hosts are specified in both
settings, then all hosts will be allowed.  These entries are the only
parameters that are concatenated, meaning that if you specify these
parameters in the system environment, the WVM file, and on the command
line then all entries will be used.
</p>

<h4><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h4>

<p>
Create a plain host with the RMI name target on port 9100.<br>
<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
java psl.worklets.WVM -name target
</font>
</p>

<p>
Create a host according to the parameters in the WVM file.<br>
<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
java psl.worklets.WVM -wvmfile wvm_properties<br>
</font>
</p>

<p>
Create a host according to the parameters in the WVM file, but with
the RMI name target and a security level of 2.<br>
<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
java -DWVM_FILE=wvm_properties psl.worklets.WVM -name target -S 2<br>
</font>
</p>

<p>
<h4><a name="local_host">Local Host</a></h4>
The sending of secure Worklets involves the creation of a local WVM
host that bootstraps the Worklet into the WVM system.  Creation of
secure Worklets and WorkletJunctions is the same as described in the
Worklet documentation except that you need to set the WVM_FILE system
property to your WVM file (described above).  This can either be done
with the -D java switch or within the application with the
System.setProperty method.  Included in the distribution should be an
example program ``SendSecure.java''.
</p>

<p>
Here is the portion within the example program that sets the security
parameters.  Also shown is the creation of the WVM.
</p>

<p>
<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
psl.worklets.OptionsParser op = new psl.worklets.OptionsParser();<br>
op.loadWVMFile(System.getProperty("WVM_FILE"));<br>
op.setWVMProperties();<br>

wvm = new psl.worklets.WVM(new Object(), InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostAddress(), <br>
                           "SendSecure", op.port, op.keysfile, op.password,<br>
                           op.ctx, op.kmf, op.ks, op.rng, op.securityLevel);<br>
</font>
</p>

<p>
The WVM_FILE system property was set on the command line like this:<br>
<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
java -DWVM_FILE=wvm_properties SendSecure localhost target 9101 Apps.Face 1 0 mysend<br>
</font>
</p>

<p>
You can also manage the WorkletJunction transport methods by setting
the transportMethods to a combination of plainRMI, secureRMI,
plainSocket, and secureSocket.  The plainRMI and secureRMI keywords
specify the type of registry used by that server.  The type of server
cannot be specified because the parameters for which type of socket to
use is set at creation time.  The plainSocket and secureSocket
keywords specify which type of socket to communicate with.  The
security will always default to the ``parent'' if not set.  So if the
Worklet.isSecure and the WorkletJunction.isSecure have not been
specified, then the WorkletJunction will default to the security of
the current WVM system.  The default for plain systems is plainRMI and
plainSocket and the default for secure systems is secureRMI and
secureSocket.  If WorkletJunction.isSecure is set and the
WorkletJunction.isSecure has not been set then those WorkletJunctions
will default to the security level of the Worklet.  The last, and
highest priority level is at the WorkletJunction.  You can either use
the isSecure method or specify the methods through the
transportMethods function.  Using the transportMethods function alone
is sufficient, and will override the isSecure method.  Here's an
example of how to set the methods:
</p>

<p>
<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
String[] tm = {"secureRMI", "plainRMI", "secureSocket", "plainSocket"};<br>
wjxn.setTransportMethods(tm);<br>
</font>
</p>


<h3><a name="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a></h3>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
How do I create my own public/private keystore and how
do I self certify it?
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of how to create a keystore named testkeys with the
password asd123.  In general you do not want to specify the password
in the command used.  When not specified on the command line the
keytool program will prompt you for a password.  The following 
command line should all be on the same line.
</p>

<p>
<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
keytool -genkey -dname "cn=Foo Bar, ou=Columbia University, o=PSL, \<br>
        c=US" -alias foobar -keypass asd123 -keystore testkeys \<br>
        -storepass asd123 -validity 180
</font>
</p>

<p>
The example also self-certifies the keystore with a validity time of
180 days.  A better way to certify the keystore would be to create a
certificate request and then send it to a third party certifier (see
Java JSSE docs).  The entries that reside in the WVM file that are
related to the file that was just created are:
</p>

<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
WVM_KEYSFILE=testkeys<br>
WVM_PASSWORD=asd123<br>
javax.net.ssl.trustStore=testkeys<br>
</font>

<p>
to view details about the keystore you can do:
</p>

<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
keytool -list -keystore testkeys
</font>

<li> 
<p>
Where do I find out more information about the available
algorithms that I can use?
</p>

<p>
See the Java documentation about security.  Specifically, look at the
JSSE and JCE docs.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
What about java policies? 
</p>

<p>
In my implementation the java policies do not play a role.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Are Worklets signed?
</p>

<p>
Worklets themselves are not signed.  Security is at the level of the WVM's.  Once
WVMs have authenticated one other, then communication, including that of Worklets, 
is trusted.

<h3>Possible errors</h3>

<ul>

<li>
The most common errors pertain to the keysfile and the file holding
the CA certificates.  Either these files are spelled incorrectly when
specified or the password is incorrect.  Another set of parameters to
check are the permissions for the files.  Make sure they at least give user
read rights.<br><br> </li>

<li>RMI server cannot bind to registry. <br>
Upon trying to bind a RMI server, if you get this error: <br>
<font  size=2 face='Terminal, Arial'>
Shutting down; cannot bind to a non-local host: 128.59.23.10java.rmi.ServerException: 
               RemoteException occurred in server thread; nested exception is: 
               java.rmi.UnmarshalException: Transport return code invalid
</font>
<p>
Check that the security level of the server and registry are
compliant.  If it is secure, then it is expecting the registry to be
secure as well, and is thus communicating through secure protocols.
Security levels of 0 and 1 (none, and low) can bind on the same
registry.  Security levels of 2 and 3 (medium and high) can also bind
together on the same registry, but cannot be matched with levels 0 and
1.  Another issue to be aware of is the RMI class loader of the
Registry.  If the Registry is created with a secure RMI server, the
instatiation of the server sets the RMI class loader to our secure
implementation and essentially sets the RMI class loader for that JVM.
Therefore when other non-secure servers try to bind, the registry
interacts with the secure RMI class loader, and a remote exception is
thrown.  To prevent this from happening you should create the registry
with a plain server.
