README for JunctionPlanner project by Dan Phung.  

Included in this tag (-r JunctionPlanner) of the worklets system is
a suite of test applications (from Manifest): 
Send.java		: test application using JunctionPlanner that uses iterations and interval
SendDate.java		: "" "" that uses Date
SendMany.java		: "" ""that deploys several WorkletJunctions
SendNotify.java		: "" "" sends a WorkletJunction to wakeUp a referenced WorkletJunction
getStats.java		: "" "" sends a WorkletJunction to dump the stats of a remote WVM
Apps/Face.java		: "" "" that prints a face
Apps/MySleep.java	: "" "" that waits for 10 seconds
demo.sh			: shell script that runs several tests.

The "Send" applications contain examples of Worklets that have
different JunctionPlanners.  The file demo.sh holds examples of how to
use those applications.

Please feel free to email me if you have any questions on how to use 
the test applications.
