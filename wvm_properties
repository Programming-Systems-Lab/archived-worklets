# Description: This is an example WVMFILE holding the parameters
# needed for secure WVM startup.  Note that there is a field for the
# password in this file.  It is VERY important that the security of
# this file is set at the OS level, meaning that the permissions on
# this file should be set accordingly.  For example, for maximum
# security I would set the permission to user read-only.  This can be
# done under unix with the following: 
# chmod a-rwx wvm_properties 
# chmod u+r wvm_properties

# this first line is needed for internal purposes.
java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoaderSpi=psl.worklets.WVM_RMIClassLoaderSpi

# WVM host related parameters
WVM_RMI_PORT=9100	# port that the rmi registry will be created on
WVM_RMI_NAME=target	# name that the RMI server will be bound to

# Security related parameters 
WVM_KEYSFILE=testkeys	# file holding the public/private keys
WVM_PASSWORD=passphrase	# password into the keysfile. 
WVM_SSLCONTEXT=TLS	# SSL context instance to use
WVM_KEYMANAGER=SunX509	# key manager implementation type
WVM_KEYSTORE=JKS	# key store implementation type
WVM_RNG=SHA1PRNG	# random number generator algorithm to use
javax.net.ssl.trustStore=samplecacerts # location of the certified security certificates.
WVM_HOSTS_ALLOW=localhost,127.0.0.1    # allowed hosts
WVM_HOSTS_DENY=			       # denied hosts
WVM_FILE=wvm_properties	# reference to this file

# security level of the WVM.  
# 0: no security. 
# 1: low security = plain RMI Registry, secure RMI server, 
#     plain and secure server sockets, and 
#     plain and secure class loaders.
# 2: medium security = same as 1 but with a secure RMI Registry
# 3: high security = secure RMI Registry, secure RMI server, 
#    secure server socket and secure class loaders.
