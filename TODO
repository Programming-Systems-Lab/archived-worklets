=============
  - Same JVM cannot shutdown an RMIRegistry and start another one ... 
	- have a -v ... --visual option to WVM .. to indicate VISUAL

=============
  - http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-10-1996/jw-10-indepth-2.html
	  add to ClassLoader: if className.startWith("psl.worklets"), throw
		new ClassNotFoundException: this will prevent classloaders from
		loading any "new" psl.worklets class

12 March 2001
=============
  - use RMISocketFactory for +1 Registries in the same JVM

10 March 2001
=============
  - add WVM.out: a PrintStream oject, same as System.out by default   ;)

07 March 2001
=============
  - kill -9 does not let the shutdown thread execute, so
    the next Registry will not be nominated ... in such a
    case
  - need security mechanism so that only those worklets that
    can present a known set of credentials are allowed to
    execute

05 March 2001
=============
  - Worklets making persistent changes to the target site.

04 March 2001
=============
  - RTU should try to [re]-establish RMI registration
    + possibly [re]-create RMI Registry
    + possibly [re]-register with RMI Registry

04 March 2001
=============
  - modify ClassFileServer to "spy" on outgoing Class files
  - subclass URLClassLoader to "cache" URL-Loaded Class files,
    and dump to local file system

03 March 2001
=============
  - add java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry                              ;)
    + first app creates registry                                      ;)
      - others getRegistry() and work from there                      ;)
      - when first app unregisters, it "notifies" other apps          ;)
      - one of the other apps then creates registry                   ;)
    + if registry exists, join                                        ;)
      - if registry sends "notification", re-join                     ;)
        + if unsuccessful after 3 attempts, create registry
